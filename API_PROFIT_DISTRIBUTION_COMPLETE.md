# Complete Profit Distribution System - Implementation Guide

## Overview
The profit distribution system now supports full admin control with automatic profit/loss handling for both partial and final distributions.

## System Architecture

### Frontend → Backend Flow
1. Partner submits profit distribution request
2. Admin reviews request in admin panel
3. Admin can edit ALL distribution values
4. System automatically detects profit vs loss
5. Admin approves → API processes distribution
6. Investors receive funds in their wallets

## API Endpoint Changes

### `/api/admin/profit-distribution-requests/[id]/approve`

#### Request Body (All Optional - Falls Back to Original Values)
```typescript
{
  // Distribution amounts
  totalAmount: number,              // Total amount to distribute
  estimatedProfit: number,          // Profit amount (can be negative)
  estimatedGainPercent: number,     // Profit percentage
  estimatedClosingPercent: number,  // Deal closing percentage
  estimatedReturnCapital: number,   // Capital to return
  
  // Commission settings
  sahemInvestPercent: number,       // Sahem Invest commission %
  reservedGainPercent: number,      // Reserve percentage
  
  // Loss flag
  isLoss: boolean                   // True = loss scenario (no commissions)
}
```

#### Response
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  message: string,  // Different message for loss vs profit
  summary: {
    totalProfit: number,
    totalAmount: number,
    investorDistribution: number,   // Profit distributed to investors

    estimatedClosingPercent: number
  }
}
```

## Distribution Logic

### Scenario 1: PARTIAL Distribution (Always Profit)
```
Profit Distribution:
├── Total Profit = estimatedProfit
├── Sahem Commission = Profit × sahemInvestPercent / 100
├── Reserve = Profit × reservedGainPercent / 100
└── To Investors = Profit - Sahem - Reserve

Capital: NOT returned (deal still ongoing)
```

**Example:**
- Profit: $10,000
- Sahem (10%): $1,000
- Reserve (10%): $1,000
- To Investors: $8,000
- Capital: $0 (not returned yet)

### Scenario 2: FINAL Distribution - PROFIT
```
Profit Distribution:
├── Total Profit = estimatedProfit
├── Sahem Commission = Profit × sahemInvestPercent / 100
├── Reserve = Profit × reservedGainPercent / 100
└── To Investors Profit = Profit - Sahem - Reserve

Capital Distribution:
└── To Investors Capital = estimatedReturnCapital

Total to Each Investor = (Profit Share + Capital Share) × Investment Ratio
```

**Example:**
- Total Amount: $120,000
- Profit: $20,000 (20% gain)
- Capital Return: $100,000
- Sahem (10%): $2,000
- Reserve (10%): $2,000
- To Investors: $16,000 profit + $100,000 capital = $116,000

### Scenario 3: FINAL Distribution - LOSS
```
Loss Distribution:
├── Sahem Commission = $0 (DISABLED)
├── Reserve = $0 (DISABLED)
├── Profit = $0 (no profit)
└── To Investors Capital = totalAmount (all remaining funds)

Total to Each Investor = Total Amount × Investment Ratio
Loss per Investor = Original Investment - Amount Received
```

**Example:**
- Original Investment: $100,000
- Remaining Amount: $70,000
- Loss: $30,000 (-30%)
- Sahem: $0 (no commission on loss)
- Reserve: $0 (no reserve on loss)
- To Investors: $70,000 (for capital recovery)

---

## Database Updates

When a distribution is approved, the system updates:

### 1. ProfitDistributionRequest
```typescript
{
  status: 'APPROVED',
  reviewedBy: adminUserId,
  reviewedAt: new Date(),
  
  // All edited fields saved
  totalAmount: finalTotalAmount,
  estimatedProfit: finalEstimatedProfit,
  estimatedGainPercent: finalEstimatedGainPercent,
  estimatedClosingPercent: finalEstimatedClosingPercent,
  estimatedReturnCapital: capitalReturnAmount,
  sahemInvestPercent: finalSahemPercent,
  reservedGainPercent: finalReservedPercent
}
```

### 2. Transactions Created
For each investor:

**Profit Scenario:**
- `RETURN` transaction (capital)
- `PROFIT_DISTRIBUTION` transaction (profit)

**Loss Scenario:**
- `RETURN` transaction only (partial capital recovery)

### 3. ProfitDistribution Records
Created for each investor showing:
- Amount (positive for profit, negative for loss)
- Profit rate (percentage)
- Investment share
- Status: COMPLETED
- Period: FINAL or PARTIAL

### 4. Wallet Updates
```typescript
// Profit Scenario
walletBalance += capitalReturn + profitShare
totalReturns += profitShare

// Loss Scenario
walletBalance += capitalReturn (partial)
totalReturns += 0 (no profit)
```

### 5. Notifications

**For Investors - Profit:**
```
Title: "تم استلام التوزيع النهائي"
Message: "تم إضافة X دولار كأرباح من الصفقة Y إلى محفظتك وتم إرجاع رأس المال Z دولار"
```

**For Investors - Loss:**
```
Title: "تم استلام التوزيع النهائي"
Message: "تم إرجاع X دولار من رأس المال من الصفقة Y. لم تحقق الصفقة ربحاً، وتم استرداد جزء من رأس المال."
```

**For Partner:**
```
Title: "تم الموافقة على توزيع الأرباح"
Message: Different based on profit/loss scenario
```

## Investment Ratio Calculation

Each investor receives their share based on their investment ratio:

```typescript
// Group all investments by investor
investorTotalInvestment = sum of all investments by this investor

// Calculate ratio
investmentRatio = investorTotalInvestment / totalProjectInvestment

// Calculate investor's share
investorProfitShare = totalProfitForInvestors × investmentRatio
investorCapitalReturn = totalCapitalReturn × investmentRatio
```

**Example:**
- Total Project Investment: $100,000
- Investor A invested: $10,000 (10%)
- Investor B invested: $25,000 (25%)
- Investor C invested: $65,000 (65%)

If profit to investors = $16,000 and capital = $100,000:
- Investor A gets: $1,600 profit + $10,000 capital
- Investor B gets: $4,000 profit + $25,000 capital
- Investor C gets: $10,400 profit + $65,000 capital

---

## Commission Handling

### Normal (Profit) Scenario
```typescript
sahemAmount = (profit × sahemPercent) / 100
reserveAmount = (profit × reservePercent) / 100
```

### Loss Scenario
```typescript
sahemAmount = 0  // Disabled
reserveAmount = 0  // Disabled
```

**Frontend UI:**
- Commission input fields are disabled when loss is checked
- Visual indicators show 0% commissions
- Warning message: "لا عمولة في حالة الخسارة"

---

## Validation Rules

### Frontend Validation
1. For profit scenarios: `sahemPercent + reservePercent <= 100`
2. Loss flag only available for FINAL distributions
3. All amount fields must be non-negative (except profit can be negative)
4. Closing percent must be 0-100%

### Backend Validation
1. Request must be in PENDING status
2. Only ADMIN role can approve
3. Deal must exist and have investments
4. Total investment amount must be > 0

---

## Error Handling

### Common Errors
- **404**: Distribution request not found
- **400**: Request already processed
- **400**: No investments found
- **401**: Unauthorized (not admin)
- **500**: Transaction failed

### Transaction Safety
- All database operations wrapped in a single transaction
- 30-second timeout for transaction completion
- Rollback on any error
- Atomic operations ensure data consistency

- Sahem: 10%
- Reserve: 10%

Expected:
- Sahem gets: $500
- Reserve: $500
- Investors get: $4,000
- Capital returned: $0
```

### Test Case 2: Final Profit Distribution
```

## Migration Notes

### No Database Schema Changes Required
The existing schema already supports all needed fields. The changes are purely logical:
- `estimatedProfit` can now be negative
- `sahemInvestPercent` and `reservedGainPercent` can be 0
- New logic in API endpoint handles profit/loss scenarios

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing distributions remain unchanged
- Old requests work with new system
- Default values ensure smooth transition

---

## Monitoring & Logs

The API logs key information:
```
Processing LOSS scenario: Total remaining X goes to investors for capital recovery
Processing PROFIT scenario: Profit X, Sahem Y, Reserve Z, Investors W, Capital V
Processing N unique investors from M investments
```

Monitor these logs to ensure correct distribution calculations.

1. **Complete flexibility** for admins to adjust any distribution value
2. **Automatic handling** of profit and loss scenarios
3. **Fair distribution** based on investment ratios
4. **No commission** in loss scenarios (protect investors)
5. **Transparent preview** of exact amounts before approval
6. **Atomic processing** with transaction safety
